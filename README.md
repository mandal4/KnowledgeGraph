# Knowledge Graph with Word Vectors
This is a reference code for building knowledge graph from Glove pretrained word vectors!
The knowledge graph represent each similarity between each pair of categories (in categories such as Pascal VOC and MS COCO)
I use https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ to use pretrained word vectors.

The code is easy to follow..!
